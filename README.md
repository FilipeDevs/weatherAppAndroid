A simple and straightforward weather application developed for Android.

## Tech Stack

**Android Studio (Jetpack Compose / Kotlin)**

## Features

- Current Weather: Provides current weather for any specific city or location.

- Short-term forecast: Forecast for the next 5 days.

- Geolocation: Allows the app to automatically obtain weather data for the user's current location, thereby showing them weather information for their location.

- City List Management: User can add cities to their personal list, allowing them to track the weather conditions of multiple locations.

- Integrated Widget: Widget on the device home screen, allowing a quick glance at weather conditions without opening the full app.
